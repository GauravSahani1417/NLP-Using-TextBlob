# NLP-Using-TextBlob
Experimented with the amazing NLP Library TextBlob. It provides a simple API for diving into common natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase extraction, sentiment analysis, classification, translation, and more. I have experimented with various features of TextBlob and presented in form of Colab Notebook.
