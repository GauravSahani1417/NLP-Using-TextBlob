I had two fathers, a rich one and a poor one. One was highly
educated and intelligent. He had a Ph.D. and completed four years
of undergraduate work in less than two years. He then went on to
Stanford University, the University of Chicago, and Northwestern
University to do his advanced studies, all on full financial scholarships.
The other father never finished the eighth grade.
Both men were successful in their careers, working hard all their
lives. Both earned substantial incomes. Yet one always struggled
financially. The other would become one of the richest men in Hawaii.
One died leaving tens of millions of dollars to his family, charities, and
his church. The other left bills to be paid.
